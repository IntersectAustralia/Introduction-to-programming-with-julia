In this course, you learnt about the different types of variables and structures. You also learnt about the three main concepts in programming, loops, conditionals and functions, and you applied all these concepts on a realistic scenario using inflammation datasets. 

If you do not feel confortable with these concepts, we strongly recommend to do this course again on yourself at your own pace. 

If you would like to explore more about the Julia programming language, there are several online tutorials and detailed documentation. Below, you can find some useful links for tutorials, documentation, etc:
