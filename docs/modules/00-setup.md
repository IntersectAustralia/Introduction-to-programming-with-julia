# What will I need?

We will be logging into a real HPC cluster for this course, so you will not need to install much software on your own computer. However, you will need:
- A program that lets you login to remote computer via Secure Shell (SSH for short).
  - **Windows users:** Download and install [PuTTy](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) or [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
  - **Mac users:** Press Command + Space bar, Type `â€œTerminal"` & Press Enter
  Or Applications > Utilities > Terminal
  - **Unix/Linux users:** Open your favourite terminal.
- A Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) program for transferring files to and from a compute cluster, such as [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)
- An account for a compute cluster. Don't worry if you don't have one, we'll sort this out for you at the course.
