Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text 

Let's create a variable called word
```python
word = "lead"
```
{: .source}

If we would like to print each letter of the variable word, we should do:
```python
println(word[1])
println(word[2])
println(word[3])
println(word[4])
```
{: .source}

However, this is a not a good practise because:
1 text text
1 text text
