# Introduction

Welcome to Intersect's Introduction to Programming with Julia course for researchers.

## Why Julia?

Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for numerical computing. In addition, the Julia developer community is contributing a number of external packages through Julia’s built-in package manager at a rapid pace. IJulia, a collaboration between the Jupyter and Julia communities, provides a powerful browser-based graphical notebook interface to Julia. The core of the Julia implementation is licensed under the MIT license. 

## Performance

Julia’s compiler combined with the language’s design allow it to approach and often match the performance of C. To get a sense of the relative performance of Julia compared to other languages that can or could be used for numerical and scientific computing, we’ve written a small set of micro-benchmarks in a variety of languages: C, Fortran, Julia, Python, Matlab/Octave, R, JavaScript, Java, Lua, Mathematica.

# Flexibility

By design, Julia allows you to range from tight low-level loops, up to a high-level programming style, while sacrificing some performance, but gaining the ability to express complex algorithms easily. This continuous spectrum of programming levels is a hallmark of the Julia approach to programming and is very much an intentional feature of the language. 

The language can be built as a shared library, so users can combine Julia with their own C/Fortran code or proprietary third-party libraries. Furthermore, Julia makes it simple to call external functions in C and Fortran shared libraries, without writing any wrapper code or even recompiling existing code. You can try calling external library functions directly from Julia’s interactive prompt, getting immediate feedback.

# Parallelisation

Julia does not impose any particular style of parallelism on the user. Instead, it provides a number of key building blocks for distributed computation, making it flexible enough to support a number of styles of parallelism, and allowing users to add more.
